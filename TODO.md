# TODO:

- make sure same file won't get processed twice
- add pulldown-cmark for markdown parsing
- add [tailwindcss-typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) to style the html parsed from the markdown

# Later

- add custom code component

# Done

- on resize scroll to the active slide with no animation (to keep it persistent when changing resolution or window size)
